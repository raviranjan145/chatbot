Why we Build this 
=================



At OpenAI, we believe that deep learning generally—and deep reinforcement learning specifically—will play central roles in the development of powerful AI technology. To ensure that AI is safe, we have to come up with safety strategies and algorithms that are compatible with this paradigm. As a result, we encourage everyone who asks this question to study these fields.
