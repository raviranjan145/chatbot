Requests
========

Requests is an Apache2 Licensed HTTP library, written in Python. It is designed to be used by humans to interact with the language. This means you don’t have to manually add query strings to URLs, or form-encode your POST data. Don’t worry if that made no sense to you. It will in due time.

What can Requests do?

Requests will allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python. With it, you can add content like headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters via simple Python libraries. It also allows you to access the response data of Python in the same way.

Speech_recognition
==================

Speech recognition has its roots in research done at Bell Labs in the early 1950s. Early systems were limited to a single speaker and had limited vocabularies of about a dozen words. Modern speech recognition systems have come a long way since their ancient counterparts. They can recognize speech from multiple speakers and have enormous vocabularies in numerous languages.
